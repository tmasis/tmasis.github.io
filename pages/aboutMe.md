I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Brendan O'Connor](https://brenocon.com) and a member of the [SLANG Lab](https://slanglab.cs.umass.edu) and the larger [UMass NLP group](https://nlp.cs.umass.edu). My research is in the domain of natural language processing and computational sociolinguistics. In particular, I am interested in improving NLP tools for low-resource and low-prestige language data (such as nonstandard language varieties, endangered languages, or informal written language/social media) in order to better serve speakers of nonstandard and primarily spoken languages; applying computational methods to sociolinguistic analyses of such language data; and investigating questions about human storytelling in both spoken and written forms.
