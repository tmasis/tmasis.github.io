I am a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, advised by [Brendan O'Connor](https://brenocon.com) and supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship. 
I'm a member of the [SLANG Lab](https://slanglab.cs.umass.edu) and the larger [UMass NLP group](https://nlp.cs.umass.edu). 

My research is in the domain of natural language processing and computational social science. In particular, I'm interested in using computational methods to investigate linguistic or social phenomena, especially ones relevant to marginalized groups, in text data. 

I also live with a chronic pain condition, which significantly impacts my life as well as my ability to work. Here are some resources on disability and why health/ability to be productive is morally neutral:
